To address the defect related to tags in the Conduit project, follow these steps:

Understanding the Defect

When creating a new article, tags are broken up into individual characters on the post view page.
New tags are not shown on the home page under "Popular Tags" even after a page refresh.
Expected Behavior:

Users should be able to enter tags in a comma-separated list in the "tag" form field.
Tags should be split by commas and trimmed for whitespace.
Any new tags should appear on the home page in the "Popular Tags" section after a page refresh.
Steps to Fix the Defect
Inspect the Code:

Backend (NestJS): Check how tags are handled when a new article is created. Look at the service and repository methods related to saving and fetching tags.
Frontend (Angular): Verify how tags are rendered on the post view page and the home page. Look at the component responsible for displaying tags.
Problem 1: Tags Broken Up Into Individual Characters

Root Cause Analysis:
Tags might be stored or displayed as individual characters due to incorrect data processing or display logic.
Instructions for Fixing:
Check if the tags are correctly formatted before being saved to the database.
Ensure the tags are properly joined or concatenated when rendering them on the post view page.
Problem 2: New Tags Not Shown on the Home Page

Root Cause Analysis:
The home page may not be fetching or updating the list of popular tags correctly.
Instructions for Fixing:
Ensure that after creating a new article with tags, the tags are correctly updated in the database.
Verify that the "Popular Tags" section on the home page retrieves and displays the updated tags list.
Implementation Guide
Backend Fixes (NestJS):

Service Layer: Ensure tags are processed and stored correctly.
Controller Layer: Make sure the API endpoints handle tags correctly when creating or updating articles.
Repository Layer: Confirm that tags are saved and queried efficiently.
Frontend Fixes (Angular):

Component for Post View: Check if tags are correctly parsed and displayed. Ensure no logic is splitting tags into characters.
Component for Popular Tags: Verify that this component fetches and displays updated tags correctly.
Code Example
Hereâ€™s a conceptual example of how to fix the issue:

Backend (NestJS):

// In article.service.ts
async createArticle(createArticleDto: CreateArticleDto): Promise<Article> {
    const tags = createArticleDto.tags.split(',').map(tag => tag.trim());
    // Save article with tags
}
Frontend (Angular):


// In post-view.component.ts
displayTags(tags: string[]): string {
    return tags.join(', ');
}

// In home-page.component.ts
fetchPopularTags() {
    this.articleService.getPopularTags().subscribe(tags => {
        this.popularTags = tags;
    });
}
Testing
Create a New Article:

Use the form to enter tags and create an article.
Verify that the tags are correctly displayed on the post view page.
Refresh Home Page:

Ensure the new tags appear in the "Popular Tags" section.
